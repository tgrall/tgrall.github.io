title: "A very good HTML Editor... and open source"
---
I have started to use on my Mac and PC the free HTML editor [NVU](http://nvu.com), it is really a great product!

Key Features:

* Multi Plaform: MacOS X, Linux, Windows... the project has been started by [LinSpire](http://www.linspire.com/)... so not a big surprise
* FTP Site manager
* Good CSS Editor and Integration to the HTML Editor
* Form Editing
* Based on Gecko

Nothing revolutionnary compare with DreamWeaver or FrontPage.. except that it is still very powerfull and free...

I hope that some Open Source developers will take time to develop Dav Site management, Source Control integration, JSP Development (at least same as the PHP stuff it currently has...)
