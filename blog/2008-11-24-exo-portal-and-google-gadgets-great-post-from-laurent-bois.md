I cannot find time to post any interesting things lately, so I can only share great stuff with readers.

This week end, [Laurent Bois](http://www.laurentbois.com/) has published a great post about:

* [Deploying a remote (OpenSocial) Google Gadget made with GWT in eXo](http://laurentbois.com/2008/11/23/deploy-a-remote-opensocial-google-gadget-made-with-gwt-in-exo/)

Take a look to this tutorial, that is based on eXo Portal 2.5 and eXo WebOS 1.5.
