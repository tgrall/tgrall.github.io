Last week I was invited to present eXo Cloud IDE during the SAP Cloud Inside. This SAP Community event was a great opportunity to discuss about the cloud with an interesting point of view: the impact of the cloud for SAP customers (especially administrators and developers).

During this presentation I have introduced the [eXo Cloud IDE](http://www.cloud-ide.com/), and I did a demonstration in which O have built and deployed applications : Open Social Gadgets, Ruby on Rails and Java/Spring, and explain how it could be extended to SAP business services.

Here the slides that I have used during this presentation:
