The same way you are taking time to list the different services, their granularity,  their QoS, you need to take some time to analyze the different solution. For example when you choose to use an ESB, BPEL engine with their connectivity capabilities, what are the best way to connect to a system (SOAP, JMS, JDBC, JCA, Java, ..), how to code the logic (Java, BPEL, business rules, ...) and for each of this question think about the impact of it on your system.
