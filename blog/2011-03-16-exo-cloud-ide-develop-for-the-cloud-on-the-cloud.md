Yesterday, eXo has launched a new cloud based service: the [eXo Cloud IDE](http://www.cloud-ide.com/). This IDE is an online service that facilitates the development of gadgets and mashups that could be deployed directly to a PaaS.

Before launching this service on the Cloud we, eXo team and customers, have used the IDE embedded in the [eXo Platform](http://www.exoplatform.com/company/en/platform/exo-platform-35) to extend our intranet and customer deployments (some of the modules that we have developed live on our intranet are available as plugins on the [eXo Resource Center](http://www.exoplatform.com/company/en/Content-types/Plugins)).

This IDE is the last mile between the users and the developers. It provides a way to add new services asked by business users at a lower cost with a good time to market. And all this based on standards that corporate and Web developers like : REST Services using [JAX-RS](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=311) and UI based on [OpenSocial](http://www.opensocial.org/) gadgets in which you can leverage all the cool and powerful features of HTML5.

What eXo has launched yesterday is a big step for developers since you can now develop, test and deploy your gadgets and services online, and this in your "personal environment" using eXo Cloud IDE supports multi-tenancy. I won't go in all the features of the IDE since you can test it yourself by joining the [beta program](http://cloud-ide.com/) and look at this video:
