In my Next.js project, I encountered a challenge while working on a form that involved managing a list of values. Being a beginner, I found myself unsure about the logic required to extract the selected value from the list and update the state of the component.

Fortunately, as I delved into coding, GitHub Copilot came to my aid with a suggested code snippet:

```javascript
if (field === "brand.id") {
    let brand = brands.find(brand => brand.id === value);
    setBoard({
        ...board,
        brand: brand
    });
    return;
}
```

Experience the efficiency and precision of Copilot in action by watching the video demonstration below:
