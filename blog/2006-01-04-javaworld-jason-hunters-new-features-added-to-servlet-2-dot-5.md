Jason Hunter has published an interesting article about [new features added to servlet 2.5](http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-01-2006/jw-0102-servlet.html). The focus of this article is like most of the JEE 5 goals all about simplification, easy of use, this is done by leveraging Java5 annotations (resources refences, life cycle support,...), some improvements around the web.xml, and cross context sessions support.
