title: "JSR 198 Early Draft Open For Review"
---
The [JSR-198:A Standard Extension API for Integrated Development Environment](http://http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=198) expert group has made the early draft available for [review](http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/edr/jsr198/index.html).

I really love this JSR and I am very happy that is now making progress because I played around in the past with Oracle JDeveloper Plugin APIs and I was disappointed that my work could not be used in other IDE...

[Oracle JDeveloper 10g (10.1.3)](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/jdev/index.html) API will be based on the JSR 198. Take a look the [Oracle JDeveloper Extension page](http://http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/jdev/htdocs/partners/addins/exchange/index.html).

On my side I have to dig out the old extensions that I wrote for 9.0.3 and migrate them to 10.1.3, I will start with the small [Lejos](http://lejos.sourceforge.net/) extension, if I can find it... It has been so long since I did not play with my legos...
