The 2005 edition of JavaOne will be a very good one, at least based of what Oracle is planning to do.

### Oracle Booth

I invite you to come on the Oracle booth (_booth 625_) where Oracle Developers and Product Managers will be pleased to talk, and demonstrate the latest technologies and their integration in our product (J2EE 1.4, EJB 3.0, JSF, BPEL, Web Services, RFID and more...). Like last year we provide you a chance to *win lot of cool stuff*. First of all enter a raffle for a chance to win a Sony PlayStation 2, Star Wars PC game packs, and Atari joysticks.

Also the first 500 people to submit an entry survey with a stamp from an Oracle demo pod will receive a ticket to see [Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith](http://www.starwars.com/episode-iii/) the evening of Tuesday, June 28.

I will be present on the J2EE Demo pod on Monday morning and I will be please to stamp you to offer you a ticket for the Stars Wars... but remember you can get a ticket for the space too -yes you can go to the space-, by participating to the [Oracle Space Sweepstakes](http://oracle.promotionexpert.com/SpaceSweepstakes/en/index.jsp?&Src=3559501&Act=20).

### Meet the Gurus

The Oracle booth also is a place where you can meet several gurus for a presentation and discussion. Here some of the subjects that will be presented:

* J2EE and EJB 3.0
* JSF, and advanced HTML/AJaX features
* SOA, BPEL
* Apache Maven

You can find the [schedule on OTN](http://www.oracle.com/technology/events/javaone05/gurus.html).

### Sessions and BOF

Oracle is also proud to have 16 technical sessions and BOF, you can find the list of them [here](http://www.oracle.com/technology/events/javaone05/sessions.html).  One of them is my favorite:

* "_Oracle Application Server Containers for J2EE (OC4J): Meet the Developers_". It will be Monday 27th at 9:30pm, this is the chance for you to meet, and interact with the J2EE and Web Services developers from Oracle.

See you there and enjoy JavaOne 2005!
