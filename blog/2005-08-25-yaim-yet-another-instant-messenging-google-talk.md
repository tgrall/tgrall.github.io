title: "YAIM (Yet Another Instant Messenging): Google Talk"
---
I have been playing around with [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/) It is quite nice, once again I like the look... But I do not see 'revolutionnary' features...
Like Skype I was able to use it at work IM and Voice chat...
I like the fact that they [document](http://www.google.com/talk/otherclients.html) how to work around their lack of platform support... I would like to have a mac version... I am surprised that Mac users in Google did not yet implement it!

Fo developer perspective it is interesting to know that they use standard based protocol such as Jabber/XMPP, and they invite people to use the API (since open standard) and server... Take a look to the [developer section of their documentation](http://www.google.com/talk/developer.html).
