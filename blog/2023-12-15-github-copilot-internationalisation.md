![Copilot Helping ](/images/posts/2023-12-15/header.png)


In the course of developing using NextJS, the integration of internationalization became a pivotal requirement on my checklist. The aim was to enable seamless translation of the application into multiple languages, leveraging the native i18n features provided by NextJS, as outlined in the [official documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization).

To facilitate this, I organized a set of JSON files, each containing translations for the application in a specific language. For simplicity, I adopted a one-file-per-language approach, ensuring uniformity by maintaining identical keys across all files. The translation process involves replacing the values associated with each key.

To expedite this crucial task, I turned to GitHub Copilot for assistance. Witness the efficiency and precision of Copilot in action by watching the following video:

Yet again, GitHub Copilot proves to be the hero of my coding journey â€“ making my day, one efficient line of code at a time!

PS: In this video I am translating the full file, but you can also translate a single key, or a set of keys, as you type them in the IDE, GitHub Copilot completion will propose you the translation.
