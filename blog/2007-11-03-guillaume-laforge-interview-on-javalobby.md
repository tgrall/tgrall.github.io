I am sure you have seen it before, but just in case... Geertjan from JavaLobby has interviewed yesterday Guillaume, in case you do not know.. Guillaume is the Project Leader of the Groovy project and co-founder of the G2One company.

Interview: [What's so groovy about Groovy?](http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t103036.html).

In case you have not look at it, [G2One](http://www.g2one.com/) is offering many services around Groovy and Grails ... directly from the source since Guillaume, and Graeme Rocher are working there... So if you need any help on these nice technologies do not hesitate....
