I have been using JDeveloper
for many years, since the first release ;-). But I've never payed
attention to a simple and very useful feature. When you click the Help
&gt; About menu you can access all the System properties of the
Java VM used by Jdeveloper  by clicking on the Properties tab

Thanks to Gerard for the tip....
