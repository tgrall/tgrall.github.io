title: "First 2005 resolution: make a donation for South Asia"
---
My first 2005 action was to give money for south Asia. I made a donation to the Unicef Organization and my employer Oracle is matching my amount.

So think about it and take five minutes of your time to make a donation to one of this organization:

*   **American Red Cross** [International Response Fund](https://www.redcross.org/donate/donation-form.asp)
*   **AmeriCares** [South Asia Earthquake Relief Fund](https://www.americaresfoundation.net/donate/default.aspx?id=South%20Asia%20Earthquake%20Relief%20Fund)
*   **Direct Relief International** [International Assistance Fund](https://www.directrelief.org/sections/support_us/d_donate_now.html)
*   **Médecins Sans Frontières International** [Tsunami Emergency Appeal](http://www.msf.org/donations/index.cfm)
*   **Oxfam** [Asian Earthquake &amp; Tsunami Fund](https://secure.ga3.org/02/asia_earthquake04)
*   **Sarvodaya** [Relief Fund for Tsunami Tragedy](http://www.sarvodaya.org/)
*   **Save the Children** [Asia Earthquake/Tsunami Relief Fund](http://savethechildren.org/radio_asia_earthquake.asp)
