title: "My (Work) Life on a Key: XWiki and other portables applications"

Now that I am back in consulting business, I often have customers where I am not allowed to connect my Mac on the network. Annoying!!!! But this is not a big issue since now it is easy to bring you environment on a USB key.

#### XWi*key*: my wiki on a key

On a daily business, I have installed my personal [XWiki](http://www.xwiki.com/) on my 2Gb USB Key, and a JDK (for windows, on OSX I am using the default one). So with this solutions I have my personal CMS, Website and applications with me, and I can use it from any computer available. I work on any site, any meeting room directly on my Wiki even when I am not connected. I am using a packaged Entprise XWiki that comes with Jetty and HSQL, so it is a complete and self contained environment. I just changed the start and stop scripts to point to the JDK that is on the key. Nothing exceptional here, but it is very useful.

#### Others portable applications

I know that a Wiki is not enough most of the time to " bring your life with you", and you may want more, such as Open Office, Mail and Web clients, ... Some of the packages you can use:

*   [PortableApps](http://portableapps.com/) take a look to [the list of applications](http://portableapps.com/apps) that are available in a portable fashion
*   [PenDriveApps](http://pendriveapps.com/)
*   [Framakey](http://www.framakey.org/En/Index)

The next test will be to run the OS from the key, I have not done it yet, have you? Some options for this:

*   [PenDriveLinux](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/)
*   [FlashLinux](http://flashlinux.org.uk/)
