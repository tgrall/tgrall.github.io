Google has released via its [Google Code](http://code.google.com/) project an implementation of XSLT in javascript... Quite interesting to improve the development of AJaX based applications, I think this is the only reason to put the term AJaX in the project... But it is true that everytime you put AJaX in a title of something you are getting people interested...

The source code is available in [sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/goog-ajaxslt/).

Feel free to post comments into the [Google group](http://groups-beta.google.com/group/google-ajax/) created for this
