With all the Web 2.0/Social Networking noise we are all used to "virtually socialize", but now you can use it to do more and improve the quality of your trips.

The site [IDTGV and Co](http://idtgvandco.idtgv.com/) (only in French so far) allows you to enter your profile and hobbies. Then when you do a reservation for the TGV (high speed train) you can match it up with other travelers. I have not tried this service yet since I am mainly traveling in the north of France but I will for sure try it as soon as I can.... Let me know if you have tested it.
