As you may know this is Oracle Open World this week in San Francisco... I am working there all week mainly on the OC4J and JDeveloper demo pods. Come to see the new version that help you to develop J2EE and Web Services. Also I am presenting Thursday at 4pm a paper about Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Event Driven Architecture (EDA)

I invite you to join this feast... if you can not take a look to the [OTN at Oracle World blog](http://www.orablogs.com/otn_at_openworld/), that highlights important keynotes, session and demoground activities...

You can also take a look to the official [Oracle Open World Web site](http://www.oracle.com/openworld/online/index.html)
