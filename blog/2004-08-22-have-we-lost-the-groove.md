title: "Have we lost the Groove ?"

---

Like lot of Java developers I was very excited about the announcement of the creation of the JSR-241... But where are we now ?

The JSR mailing list ([http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.groovy.jsr](http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.groovy.jsr) ) is very quiet... No meeting, not a lot of question/response. And like Patrick M. I have friends that have asked to be part of the Expert Group and never had any response.

I think that the Groovy Language is really a nice way of putting Java to the next level, easier to learn, to use and still powerful... I will not go in an enumeration of the benefits of Groovy here... but just asking what the Expert Group is doing ? What is the next step for the Groovy Language and the JCP ?
