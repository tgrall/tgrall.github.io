title: "New Dynamic Menu for OracleAS Portal 10g"

---
Ronaldo Viscuso has just released a new version of his DHTML Menu Portlet. This portlet generates a DHTML menu for site navigation, with links to pages and subpages from a selected page group.

Stylesheet, height, width, mouse-over behavior, etc. are all configurable via the "Edit Defaults" page, which allows for complete customization for pretty much any desired look & feel....

The portlet, screen shots and installation document are available on the [Portal Knowledge Exchange](http://portalstudio.oracle.com/pls/ops/opstudio.wwv_main.main?p_siteid=233&p_cornerid=497710).
