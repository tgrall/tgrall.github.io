---

Sun has sent a [letter to the Java Community](http://java.sun.com/j2ee/letter/persistence.html) to start a single POJO persistence model, this will be done under the EJB 3.0 specification ([JSR-220](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220)).

You can see comments from the community on [TheServerSide Web site](http://www.theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=28995).
