Oracle JDeveloper (10.1.3.2.0) extends the SOA development features from  the previous release by introducing the Oracle WebCenter extension.  Oracle WebCenter Suite combines the standards-based, declarative development of JavaServer Faces (JSF), the flexibility and power of portals, and a set of integrated Web 2.0 services to boost end-user productivity.   Oracle WebCenter Suite provides the tools and services to embed portlets, content, customizable components, Web 2.0 content,
collaboration and communication services directly into your JavaServer Faces (JSF) application.  These WebCenter features are in addition to the large set of new features that were introduced in Oracle JDeveloper 10.1.3.0 and 10.1.3.1.0.  For more information on WebCenter, visit the
