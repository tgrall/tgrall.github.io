In the following [video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gw2vB18X3sQ), I show how to create a new product release with GitHub. This example shows how to:
- [Create a new release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github), and generate [release notes](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes) from PRs
- Upload a Maven artifact into GitHub Packages with [Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/publishing-packages/publishing-java-packages-with-maven)
- Generate new documentation site with [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)
- Use GitHub [Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) to involve your community.
