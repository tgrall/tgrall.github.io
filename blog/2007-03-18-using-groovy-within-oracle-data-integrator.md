title: "Using Groovy within Oracle Data Integrator"

categories: groovy oracle

As you may remember, Oracle acquired few months back a data integration solution from Sunopsis, and has integrated it in our product under the name "[Oracle Data Integrator](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/oracle-data-integrator/index.html)" (ODI).

One of the first thing that I look when we got this product was the support for Scripting technologies, since it makes lot of sense to have such support in any ETL. And yes ODI has support for Jython (thought BSF). So when the dev team joined Oracle, I've asked the following question "did you try to use Groovy?"... I personnaly did not take the time to test, but one of the developer did and document it in his blog:
"[Using Groovy and ODI](http://thierrychantier.blogspot.com/2007/04/groovy-and-odi.html)" from Thierry. When I get a chance I will provide a more complete sample of using Groovy in Oracle Data Integrator.
