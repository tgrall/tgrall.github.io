Yesterday was my last day at eXo... I have been working at eXo since 2008, and we have achieved many exciting things such as building [eXo Platform](http://www.exoplatform.com/), the open source social platform, and the [Cloud-IDE](http://www.cloud-ide.com/) allowing developers to build, test, and deploy applications online.

It was a great experience for me, but it is time for me to jump into a new adventure...

I am joining [Couchbase](http://www.couchbase.com/)&nbsp;as a Technical Evangelist for the EMEA Region. When I have started to work with NoSQL engines (starting with Google BigTable for [Resultri](http://www.resultri.com/)) I really enjoyed the experience and the flexibility that it gives to the developers. Then I choose to work on a documented oriented database because it looks very natural to me, and evaluate the clustering capabilities.&nbsp;This is how I discovered&nbsp;[Couchbase](http://www.couchbase.com/)&nbsp;and its community.

This new job is a great opportunity for me to do the things that I really like about software:

*   Coding applications using different languages and frameworks
*   Understanding the sysops/devops related challenges when using a new product/technology
*   And finally probably the most important part; sharing it with others!

I look forward to sharing what I like about NoSQL and Couchbase and discuss with others about their experience or needs around NoSQL.&nbsp;


See you soon online and in real life during conferences and meetups!
