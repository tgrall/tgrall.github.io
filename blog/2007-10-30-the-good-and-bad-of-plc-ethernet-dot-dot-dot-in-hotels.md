title: "The good and bad of PLC ethernet... in hotels"

categories:

I am traveling visiting partner and pleased to see that I have internet access in my room. Unfortunately it is not Wifi access but not that bad, but with PLC (Power line communication)...

So I take my PLC Adapator at the concierge. Plug it in my room and start to surf the web. Performance is good... Now I am looking for another electric plug for my MacBook AC... oh maaaan! I cannot find any other free plug.. except in the bathroom. This is really annoying and stupid... Sorry for this little post about a small and annoying experience.. alone in my PLC bedroom.
