title: "Good taste tool: del.icio.us"

---
I am starting to use [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/). A great way to manage your own bookmarks but also to share them with others...

It is fun to see how many people are sharing the same bookmarks as you, and help you to find information related to the different categories...

Also the integration with Firefox using the [delicious plugin](http://delicious.mozdev.org/) make the usage of the bookmark manager very easy. You can also use the [Apple Mac OS X client for del.icio.us](http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/).

[Here my bookmarks... still working on it](http://del.icio.us/tgrall).
