This last 2 weeks have been kind of crazy for me, and for Oracle.. Last week we were present at the Oracle Developer Tools User Group, and immediately jump in for the 10th edition of JavaOne.

I was not able to attend as much sessions as I wanted, but I had the pleasure to work a lot on the Oracle Booth in the JavaOne Pavillion. I  worked on the J2EE, JSF, BPEL and Web Services ones. It was really great, with lot of technical questions around our products; I have to say that this year we had lot of interest around JavaServer Faces and EJB.

And this has been even better after Thomas Kurian's keynote on Tuesday with the following annoucements:

* Oracle is participating to [MyFaces](http://myfaces.apache.org/) project. You can find more information on [JavaServer Faces on OTN](http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/java/jsf.html).

* Oracle will lead the development of the JSF extension for Eclipse, as you may know Oracle JDeveloper, now free, has one of the most appealing JSF Designer tool. So we are currently porting this design tools inside Eclipse, to facilitate the adoption of Faces by the developers.

* Mike Keith, Toplink Architect, will be now co-specification leader of the persistence specification. Also Oracle will develop the Reference Implementation of the persistence engine of the JEE 5 platform. As you  may know you can already start to develop EJB 3.0 within the early implementation available on [OTN](http://otn.oracle.com/ejb3). Note that the next release of Oracle Application Server 10g (10.1.3), EJB 3.0 will be supported.

* As you may have seen some weeks ago, Oracle is also the lead in the Eclipse project to implement the EJB 3 tool.

* Also still around Eclipse, Oracle, most successful player around BPEL, will continue the development of the BPEL deigner inside Eclipse and put that officially in the Eclipse Project. If you are not familiar with BPEL, I will invite you [to jump to the OTN Web Site](http://otn.oracle.com/bpel).

* Last, but not least, [Oracle JDeveloper is now free](http://otn.oracle.com/products/jdev)...
