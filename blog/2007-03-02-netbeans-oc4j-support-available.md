It has been a long time that I did not look in the update center and development wiki of Netbeans. And I have been very pleased to see that it is possible now to register OC4J 10g as a server in Netbeans 5.5 (and 6.0). To add it in your environment just do a :

*   Tools > Update Center
*   Select "Netbeans Update Center Beta"
*   Select OC4J 10gYou can then configure a new Server and run/stop the server from your IDE.

You can follow the development of this plugin directly in the [Netbeans Wiki OC4J Support](http://wiki.netbeans.org/wiki/view/OC4JSupport) page.
