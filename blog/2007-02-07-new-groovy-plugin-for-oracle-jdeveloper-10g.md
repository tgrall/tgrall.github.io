title: "New Groovy Plugin for Oracle JDeveloper 10g"

categories: groovy jdeveloper

You can find a first release of the Groovy extension for JDeveloper on the Groovy site:

* [http://groovy.codehaus.org/Oracle+JDeveloper+Plugin](http://groovy.codehaus.org/Oracle+JDeveloper+Plugin)


The plugin creates a new JDeveloper library for Groovy 1.0, allows you to create and run scripts. I hope to be able to provide more feature such as syntax coloring,  structure recognition, ... lot of ideas here...
