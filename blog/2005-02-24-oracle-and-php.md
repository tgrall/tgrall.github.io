A friend of mine was asking me:

_can I use PHP with Oracle?_

Sure you can!

And a very good source of information about PHP and Oracle is the [OTN](http://otn.oracle.com) Web site itself, and especially the [OpenSource page](http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/opensource/index.html). Here a list of my favorites:

* [Get Started with Oracle and PHP](http://www.oracle.com/technology/oramag/webcolumns/2003/techarticles/hull_php.html)
* [Installing Oracle, PHP, and Apache on Linux](http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/opensource/php/apache/inst_php_apache_linux.html)
* [An overview on globalizing Oracle PHP Applications (PDF)](http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/opensource/php/globalizing_oracle_php_applications.pdf)
* [Generic Oracle and PHP FAQ](http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/opensource/php_faq.html)
* [Oracle PHP Troubleshooting FAQ](http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/opensource/php/php_troubleshooting_faq.html)
* [PHP OTN Forum](http://otn.oracle.com/forums/php.html)

_Can I run my PHP Applications inside Oracle Application Server?_

Sure! Not only you can access the Oracle database from a PHP Application, but also if you are running Oracle Application 10_g_ the usage of mod_php is supported with Oracle HTTP Server see:

* [Statement of Direction: PHP Support on OHS](http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/opensource/php/php_ohs_sod.html)
* [PHP Instructions for OHS](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/ias/ohs/htdocs/php_ohs.htm)

_And what about development?_

Development could be done inside Oracle JDeveloper 10g using the The [Oracle JDeveloper 10g PHP Extension](http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/jdev/htdocs/partners/addins/exchange/php/index.html)
