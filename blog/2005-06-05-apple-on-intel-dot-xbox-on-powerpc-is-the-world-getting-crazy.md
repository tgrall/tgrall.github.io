Once again a rumor of [ Apple switching to Intel](http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2005/06/05/ap2077202.html) is making some noise on the net....

We won't have to wait for long since the news talks about Steve Job announcing that during his keynote at WWDC. I am currently planning to buy a new powerbook 12" (in addition to the 15" and iMac)... who knows, it may be an "Intel Inside" one ;-)

The other fun part is the deal that IBM is trying to obtain with game platform.. such as Sony and... MSFT...

We'll see tomorrow... Talking about WWDC, Oracle has a booth and some presentations for this event... I will be personally working on the pod presenting Oracle 10g stack on Mac OS X... See you this week !
