A friend of mine asked me some questions about Oracle and acquisitions. He could not, remember all of them and when they occurred...

If you have the same questions take a look to the Oracle Acquisition page on Oracle.com since 2005:

* [Oracle Strategic Acquisition](http://www.oracle.com/corporate/acquisition.html)Some others are probably missing since in 2003/2004, Collaxa was acquired by Oracle. If you do not remember Collaxa was the first release of the BPEL Process Manager.

You can also take a look to a part of the site that I like that is the [Oracle's history.](http://www.oracle.com/corporate/story.html)
