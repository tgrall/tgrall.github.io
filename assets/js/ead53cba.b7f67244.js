What I see as the biggest move is the adoption of Ajax by JavaServer Faces, and simply because it is the J2EE standard for Java Web Development. I am sure that lot of you will say that Tapestry,ROR and other existing frameworks are providing the integration now, so why bother with JSF... Hmmm, I will say that all the current solution as still geek oriented and really focus on the core developers... What I see with JSF/Ajax integration is finally enterprise developers, that are used to 4GL development tools, (where the most important part is to develop business logic not a nice framework or a new set of libraries) will be able to develop Web Applications based on components that are smart enough to give the usability of a desktop application."),(0,n.kt)("p",null,"To give an idea of what I mean, you can take a look to ",(0,n.kt)("a",{parentName:"p",href:"http://www.oracle.com/technology/products/jdev/htdocs/partners/addins/exchange/jsf/index.html"},"Oracle ADF Faces components")," some of them are really powerful and provide rich interactivity to the user.
