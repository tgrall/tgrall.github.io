I am sure that most of you already know the "[Prototype Windows](http://prototype-window.xilinus.com/)"  project that provides a very powerful way to create windows and dialogs inside your Web pages. If you do not know it, take a look it's awesome!

Sebastien Gruhier, aka Mr Proto, and others have done a terrific job allowing developers to integrate exciting features with few lines of code. Find more on the [PWC site](http://prototype-window.xilinus.com/) or on [Mr Proto's blog](http://blog.xilinus.com/pwc).

In addition to the Windows API, you can also take a look to the Tranparent Message, Prototype Carousel and Prototype Graphics projects
