> Today is an important day. Weâ€™ve got some great stuff for you today.

Here we go, WWDC 2005 has started, and as usual it is hot!  You can have a summary of [Steve Jobs' keynote on Macworld Web site](http://www.macworld.com/news/2005/06/06/liveupdate/index.php).

I think the most breaking news, beside the good numbers is the confirmation of the fact that "[Apple drops IBM PowerPC line for Intel chips](http://www.macworld.com/news/2005/06/06/powerpcintel/index.php)"... What do you think? I am personally happy; this will stop the 'useless' discussion about the speed of the chip of PC versus Mac... and, I am optimistic on the fact that Macs will be faster ;-) For me the chip is not important since the only code that I write on Mac is Java based, and little bit of AppleScript...

I am impatient to see the new stuff that Apple will put in Leopard...
