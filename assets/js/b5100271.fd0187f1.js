SOAP has been one great success in term of interoperability. I am aware that REST is also a very good fit for that but since I talk about SOAP and later WS-* standards, I do not want to talk about REST more in this post, the only thing that you can put in your mind is before choosing to implement SOAP based Web Services, ask the following question to yourself: "do I really need SOAP services or REST would be enough?"... That said let\'s continue on SOAP and binary content exchange. When talking about binary content, the interoperability comes with some trade off around for example performance/message sized or impact on developer. This will be discussed later, but always keep in mind that interoperability is the key point of Web Services. If this is not the case on your project, that means you probably do not need to use SOAP that has an important overhead in general.')),(0,o.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},(0,o.kt)("p",{parentName:"li"},(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Performance")," and ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"Scalability"),' is also quite important when you are building a service based application. Especially that often you cannot predict exactly how much a service will be used. We have to keep in mind that often services are build to be reusable, it is one of the basic best practices of development, so if the service is really "reused" it is important to keep it running with acceptable performances.
