Congratulations to all the Groovy developers, and users that have done a great job with this language that is here in production. And it is interesting to see that more and more projects are using Groovy as part of their infrastructure to simplify development:

* SOAPUI
* XWiki
* Spring 2 integration
* Grails
* ... and many development teams in custom projects

So once again happy new year to all... and enjoy it with Groovy !
