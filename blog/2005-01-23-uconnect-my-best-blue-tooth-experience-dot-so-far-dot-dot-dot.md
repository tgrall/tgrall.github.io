title: "uConnect my best Blue Tooth experience.. so far..."
---
A friend a mine just bought the top of the line of the Dodge Grand Caravan... Really over-loaded...

My favorite feature is [uConnect](http://www.dodge.com/crossbrand/uconnect/dodge/interface.html), that provide hand-free voice system based on Bluetooth...

I just turned on blue tooth on my phone, and five minutes later I was able to talk to my friends and family and share that with all people in the car. I have several bluetooth stuff (Macs, PDA, Phone) and this is the first time that using uConnect that I find a really cool usage of it...

The missing feature: I would like to see an integration between my address book on the PDA to the GPS system allowing the system to direclty set the destination from an address....
