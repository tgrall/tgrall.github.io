Today, I tackled the creation of a new NextJS form for my application, opting for a sleek horizontal arrangement of components. Striving for a 100% width within the parent container proved trickier than expected. Copilot came to the rescue, aiding with the necessary math to resize the components accurately.

Catch a glimpse of the journey in this brief video:

Yet again, GitHub Copilot proves to be the hero of my coding journey â€“ making my day, one efficient line of code at a time!
