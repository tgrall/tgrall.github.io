I am sure that you know about Google Books: [http://books.google.com/](http://books.google.com/)

Even if I truly believe that Google wants the good by publishing all this information for free - We all remember the sentence: "Don't be evil" that is part of the [Google code of Conduct](http://investor.google.com/conduct.html)-. I think it is not a good idea to have only one service that provide access to the "world culture"... Competition is always good for consumer...

The French National Library ([BNF](http://www.bnf.fr/)) and some other public libraries (Hungarian, Portugal) have created a new site to offer a similar service in beta:  [http://www.europeana.eu](http://www.europeana.eu/). It is true that currently the list of books is really small compare to Google but I am inviting you to use both of then.
