![](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_aoQgQ1obiyE/R5Y9QvPDP0I/AAAAAAAAADE/loju_rH1Ie8/s200/Web+20.png) I have just created a poll -see leftbar- asking to list the different tools you are using for business. In fact I would like to have some feedback of you use of Wiki, Blogs, Instant Messaging on you daily job.

Myself I am using all of this for work:

*   Internal and external communication with Wikis
*   My blog that you are currently reading
*   Chat, I use probably more the chat than phone these days (thanks to http://meebo.com when I cannot connect with a rich client)
*   Social Networking: I am not necessarily  talking about big sites like LinkedIn/Facebook but more internal sites. For example, back at Oracle we had access to an internal Social Network site, that is now exposed at http://mix.oracle.com, and now at Sogeti, in the Cap Gemini group we do also have internal social networks.The idea behind this post/poll is to be able to discuss, with customers around Web 2.0 tools adoption in the enterprise. So do not hesitate to post a comment describing the tools and how you are using them for business.

Thanks for your vote ;)
