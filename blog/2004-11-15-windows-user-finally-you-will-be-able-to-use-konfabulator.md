title: "Windows User finally you will be able to use Konfabulator"

One of my favorites tools on my Mac is [Konfabulator](http://www.konfabulator.com/) that allows you to create -or use prebuilt- application called Widgets. This Widgets are for example battery level, weather, see the [Widget Gallery](http://www.widgetgallery.com/).

The reason why I love it is not necessary the list of existing one, but more because you can very easily develop yours using Javascript. Dowload it and start to develop your widgets, developer guide, javascript reference are available in the [Konfabulator Workshop](http://www.konfabulator.com/workshop/)
