title: "IBM article:  JAX-RPC vs JAX-WS"

I was discussing with a customer not familiar with the JAX-WS standard. I was writing him a mail explaining the difference when I found this nice article on the IBM DeveloperWorks library:

* [Web services hints and tips: JAX-RPC vs JAX-WS](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-tip-jaxwsrpc.html target=)



It is an opportunity for me to remind OracleAS users that the 10.1.3.1 stack in addition to the JAX-RPC support also provides support for:

* Attachments with MTOM, Soap with Attachment and DIME
* Annotations based development (JSR-181) that is part of JAX-WS
* WS-Security and WS-Reliability
