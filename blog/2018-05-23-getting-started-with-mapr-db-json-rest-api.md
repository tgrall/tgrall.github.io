## Introduction

In this project you will learn how to use the MapR-DB JSON REST API to:

Create and Delete tables
Create, Read, Update and Delete documents (CRUD)
MapR Extension Package 5.0 (MEP) introduced the MapR-DB JSON REST API that allow application to use REST to interact with MapR-DB JSON.

You can find information about the MapR-DB JSON REST API in the documentation: [Using the MapR-DB JSON REST API](https://maprdocs.mapr.com/home/MapR-DB/JSON_DB/UsingMapRDBJSONRESTAPI.html)

## Prerequisites

You system should have the following components:

* A running MapR 6.0.1 & MEP 5.0 cluster with the MapR-DB REST API service installed
* `curl` or equivalent tool



## Discover the MapR-DB JSON REST API

The easiest way to discover it, is to use curl command (or equivalent).

**1 - Create a table**

```
curl -X PUT \
  'https://mapr-node:8243/api/v2/table/%2Fapps%2Femp' \
  -u root:mapr \
  -k
```

In this command:

* the MapR-DB REST Service (MapR Data Access Gateway) is running on the mapr-node host with the default port `8243` using HTTPS
* the HTTP verb `PUT` on `/api/v2/table/` endoint creates a new table
* the protocol is HTTP since HTTPS is not enabled on this cluster
* the new table will be created wit the path `/apps/emp` that is encoded to `%2Fapps%2Femp`
* the user `root` with the password `mapr` is used for authentication, using basic authentication
* the `-k` parameter is used to indicate to turn off curlâ€™s verification of the certificate.

In this example, you use the basic authentication, it is also possible to use [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/introduction/). You will learn more about this when you will write an application in Go.


**2 - Insert Documents**

Insert one document

```
curl -X POST \
  'https://mapr-node:8243/api/v2/table/%2Fapps%2Femp' \
  -u root:mapr \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"_id":"user001","first_name":"John","last_name":"Doe", "age" : 28}' \
  -k
```

In this command:

* the `/api/v2/table/{path}` with the verb `GET` is used with a `condition` query parameter
* the OJAI JSON syntax is used to express the condition: `{"$eq":{"last_name":"Doe"}}`

**3 - Update a document**

The following example will increment the age by 1 and update the last name.

```
curl -X POST \
  'https://mapr-node:8243/api/v2/table/%2Fapps%2Femp%2F/document/user001' \
  -u root:mapr \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"$set" : {"last_name" : "New Doe"}, "$increment" : {"age":1}}' \
  -k
```

In this comamnd:

* the URL points to the document `_id` to update
* the HTTP verb `POST` is used to modify the resource
* the request body `-d` is the OJAI JSON Mutation that update the last name and increment the age.

You can check that the document has been updated using the following command:

```
curl -X GET \
  'https://mapr-node:8243/api/v2/table/%2Fapps%2Femp%2F/document/user001' \
  -u root:mapr \
  -k
```

**4 - Delete a document**

Delete the document with the `_id` user001.

```
curl -X DELETE \
  'https://mapr-node:8243/api/v2/table/%2Fapps%2Femp%2F/document/user001' \
  -u root:mapr \
  -k
```

In this command:

* the URI `/api/v2/table/{path}/document/{id}` with the HTTP verb `DELETE` is used to delete the document

**5 - Delete the MapR-DB JSON table**

The last step of this tutorial is to delete the table using the following command:

```
curl -X DELETE \
  'https://mapr-node:8243/api/v2/table/%2Fapps%2Femp' \
  -u root:mapr \
  -k
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial you have learned how to use the MapR-DB JSON REST API to:

* Create a table
* Insert and query documents
* Update and delete documents
* Drop table

You can now use the API to create MapR-DB JSON Application using your favorite language.
