Lot of us want to create portlets (or publish content) based on weather information. The best solution that I found is the [Weather Channel XML](http://www.weather.com/services/xmloap.html).

And I was really impressed by [xaopWeather](http://www.xoapweather.com) (PHP based)!
Let me know if you find an equivalent but Java based !
