# Learning Quarkus

I am currently learning [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/), and I am documenting my journey here with a series of blog posts.

The last time I have worked with Java and an RDBMS system was in 2012, since I have been working with Java, NodeJS and NoSQL databases. I am excited to see how Quarkus will help me to build a modern Java application with some very interesting features:

- hot reload
- active record pattern
- continuous testing
- data services
- reactive programming
