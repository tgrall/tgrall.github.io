Graeme, the Grails Project Lead has published a very interesting benchmark of Grails versus Rails applications, that is available on the Grails wiki:

*   [Grails vs Rails Performance Benchmarking](http://grails.org/Grails+vs+Rails+Benchmark)I let you read and comment on the Wiki the results... Grails development team is open to comment and improvement of the bench to capture as much information as possible.

It is also important to note that performances, productivity are very important when choosing a development environment; but something that is also key for enterprises, is the fact that Grails/Groovy "are" Java/J2EE based. This means that a Grails application is packaged, deployed, administered and monitored like any applications that already exist in the information system on J2EE application servers.
