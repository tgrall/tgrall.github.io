Welcome back to the second installment of our exploration into Quarkus and Panache! In the previous blog post, we delved into [setting default values for Panache entity fields](/blog/2023/12/09/quarkus-entity-default-value). Now, as we continue refining the WindR.org website with Quarkus integration, our primary focus shifts to implementing **Database Projection with Panache**.

Code Example on GitHub:

To accompany this discussion, I've published the complete code example on GitHub, providing you with a hands-on reference for learning and experimentation.

###  Understanding the data model

For this illustrative example, we'll work with a straightforward data model consisting of two tables: 'boards' and 'brands.' The 'boards' table contains a list of windsurfing boards, while the 'brands' table serves as a reference, linked to the 'boards' table through a foreign key relationship.

#### Panache Entities:

Let's take a closer look at the Panache entities representing these tables.

**Board.java**

```java
@Entity
@Table (
    name = "boards"
)
public class Board extends PanacheEntity {

        @ManyToOne( fetch = FetchType.LAZY, optional = false)
        @JoinColumn(name = "brand_id", nullable = false, foreignKey = @ForeignKey(name = "fk_board_brand_id"))
        public Brand brand;

        public String name;
        public String description;
        public String image;
        public String program;
}
```

**Brand.java**

```java
@Entity
@Table(
    name = "brands"
)
public class Brand extends PanacheEntity {

        public String name;
        public String description;
        public String logo;
        public String website;
        public String address;

}
```

#### Database Schema

These entities are mapped to the following database tables, reflecting the relational structure:



```sql
create table boards (
    id bigint not null,
    description varchar(255),
    image varchar(255),
    name varchar(255),
    program varchar(255),
    brand_id bigint not null,
    primary key (id)
);

create table brands (
    id bigint not null,
    address varchar(255),
    description varchar(255),
    logo varchar(255),
    name varchar(255),
    website varchar(255),
    primary key (id)
);

alter table if exists boards 
    add constraint fk_board_brand_id 
    foreign key (brand_id) 
    references brands;`

```


### Using the Panache Entities

Now, let's create a new REST endpoint that efficiently returns the list of boards and board details, thanks to the simplicity provided by Quarkus.


**BoardResource.java**

```java
@Path("/api/v1/boards")
@Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public class BoardResource {

    @GET
    public List<Board> allBoards() {
        return Board.listAll();
    }

    @GET
    @Path("{id}")
    public Board getBoard(Long id) {
        return Board.findById(id);
    }
}
```

####  Testing the REST Endpoint
So we can test the endpoint with the following command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/boards/0
```

that returns the following JSON:

```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "name": "Fanatic Skate",
  "brand": {
    "id": 0,
    "name": "Fanatic",
    "description": "Fanatic Description",
    "logo": "logo.svg",
    "website": "https://www.fanatic.com/",
    "address": null
  },
  "description": "Fanatic Skate Description",
  "image": "image.png",
  "program": "freestyle"
}
```

As you can see the JSON contains the full details of the board and brand; and all the columns are loaded from the database, as you can see in the following SQL query:

```sql
    select
        b1_0.id,
        b1_0.brand_id,
        b2_0.id,
        b2_0.address,
        b2_0.description,
        b2_0.logo,
        b2_0.name,
        b2_0.website,
        b1_0.description,
        b1_0.image,
        b1_0.name,
        b1_0.program 
    from
        boards b1_0 
    join
        brands b2_0 
            on b2_0.id=b1_0.brand_id 
    where
        b1_0.id=?
```

So, from the client perspective, it is not very efficient because you are loading the full Brand object from the database, and you are sending all the columns to the client.

#### A quick & dirty solution

Wait! Before we do that, if the reference table has a very small number of columns, you can use the `@JsonIgnoreProperties` annotation to exclude some columns from the Brand JSON serialization. For example, if you do not want to return the `description`, `logo`, `website`, and `address` columns, you can use the following annotation:

```java
    @ManyToOne( fetch = FetchType.EAGER, optional = false)
    @JoinColumn(name = "brand_id", nullable = false, foreignKey = @ForeignKey(name = "fk_board_brand_id"))
    @JsonIgnoreProperties({"description", "logo", "website", "address"})
    public Brand brand;
```

Now when you call the endpoint, you will get the following JSON:

```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "name": "Fanatic Skate",
  "brand": {
    "id": 0,
    "name": "Fanatic"
  },
  "description": "Fanatic Skate Description",
  "image": "image.png",
  "program": "freestyle"
}
```

So from the client perspective, it is better, but from the server-side, it is not very efficient because you are still loading the full Brand & Boards objects from the database.


## Efficient Data Retrieval with Database Projection:


To enhance efficiency, we introduce the concept of a projectionâ€”a query returning a subset of columns from the target entity.

I am using Java 21, so lets create a new record named `BoardProjection`:

```java
record BoardProjection(
    Long id,
    String name,
    String image,
    String program,
    @ProjectedFieldName("brand.name") String brandName
) { }
```
The process is straightforward: specify the fields you wish to include, and when referencing a field from a related table, employ the [`@ProjectedFieldName`](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.quarkus/quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache-common/latest/io/quarkus/hibernate/orm/panache/common/ProjectedFieldName.html) annotation.

To implement this projection, utilize a [`PanacheQuery`](https://javadoc.io/doc/io.quarkus/quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache/latest/io/quarkus/hibernate/orm/panache/PanacheQuery.html) and employ the project method to define the projection.


```java
    @GET
    public List<BoardProjection> allBoards() {
        PanacheQuery<Board> boards = Board.findAll();
        return boards.project(BoardProjection.class).list();
    }

    @GET
    @Path("{id}")
    public BoardProjection getBoard(Long id) {

        PanacheQuery<BoardProjection> boardQuery =
                Board.find("id", id).project(BoardProjection.class);
        return boardQuery.firstResult();
    }
```

Pretty neat !

Let's look at the API call and SQL query:

```bash 
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/boards/0
```
JSON Result
```json
{
  "id": 0,
  "name": "Skate",
  "image": "image.png",
  "program": "freestyle",
  "brandName": "Fanatic"
}
```

and the SQL query:

```sql
    select
        b1_0.id,
        b1_0.name,
        b1_0.image,
        b1_0.program,
        b2_0.name 
    from
        boards b1_0 
    join
        brands b2_0 
            on b2_0.id=b1_0.brand_id 
    where
        b1_0.id=? 
    fetch
        first ? rows only

```

By utilizing Panache's simple projection definition with a Java record, our API calls now retrieve only the essential data, optimizing both client and server-side performance.


## Conclusion

By efficiently selecting specific columns through a projection, we strike a balance between data completeness and performance, ensuring a streamlined experience for both developers and end-users alike.
