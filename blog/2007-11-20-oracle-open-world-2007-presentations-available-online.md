For the first time since 2001, I was not participating at OOW... As you may know I have moved back to France and now working for a new company [Sogeti](http://www.sogeti.com/). So I am quite happy to se that once again all the presentations are available for download there:

* [OOW 2007 Content Catalog.](http://www28.cplan.com/cc176/catalog.jsp)

I personnaly looked at OracleAS and Java presentations, and especially the one regarding SOA, performances, security and web Services:

* [New Features of Java EE 5.0 and How to Use Them](http://cboracle:oraclec6@www28.cplan.com/cbo_export/PS_S291388_291388_176-1_FIN_v3.pdf)

* [Maximizing Your Java Middleware Performance on Multicore Platforms](http://cboracle:oraclec6@www28.cplan.com/cbo_export/PS_S292174_292174_176-1_FIN_v2.pdf)

Some other presentations that I would like to read/see:

* Java EE/Java SE/Java Authorization Contract for Containers (JACC) Security in a Nutshell
* A New Approach to Diagnosing Java Application Performance
* Next-Generation Web Services Infrastructure and Interoperability
* Performance Management for SOA Applications

And I will take more time do read some others...
