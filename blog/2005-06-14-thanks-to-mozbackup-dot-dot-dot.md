title: "Thanks to MozBackup..."

---
My Windows laptop has been infected by some viruses and adware -why I am not only using my Mac and Linux computers?-, so I just reinstalled the full OS.....

I just want to use my blog to thanks the small utility [MozBackup](http://mozbackup.jasnapaka.com/) that allowed to quickly backup and recover my Firefox and Thunderbird configuration and data!

Thanks again...
