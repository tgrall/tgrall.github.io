In this brief demonstration, I showcase how GitHub Copilot help me to format data sourced from a web page and pasted into my IDE. By simply copying information from a webpage and pasting it into my coding environment, I initiate the process.

Then, with a straightforward inquiry directed to Copilot Inline Chat, I effortlessly extract specific details —such as GitHub Handles— from the text and neatly organize them into a CSV format:

Although this isn't a task I tackle daily, especially with GitHub Handles, I wanted to illustrate another practical application of Copilot that can significantly assist in your coding endeavors.
