title: "Shirky.com: In Praise of Evolvable Systems"
---

Rob,colleague of mine, pointed me to an article about "[Evolvable Systems](http://www.shirky.com/writings/evolve.html)":

*Why something as poorly designed as the Web became The Next Big Thing, and what that means for the future*.

First of all this article is very interesting, but the whole site -that I did not know- is full of truth, and fun ! ( I love the one about blogs)

I invite you to bookmark [http://www.shirky.com](http://www.shirky.com) !

Thanks again Rob!
