The first Oracle World Day for me has started with finishing the various demonstrations of the J2EE Core OC4J and Web Services demonstration Pods. Tomorrow Monday, we will be showing some very cool stuff around Web Services development and management, with some good news around Web Services Registry. Also on the J2EE Core, nice demonstrations of the different services but some of the new features of the OracleAS 10.1.3 such as the new clustering framework and the usage of scripting technologies, especially Groovy, to administer and monitor OracleAS, thanks to JMX!

What about the rest of the day, I was invited to the Web Services Special Interest Group, WS-SIG, - no.. this is not a new acronym in the WS-* world-. This new SIG has been created in the beginning of the year and on the behalf of IOUG, please take a look to the [WSSIG web site](http://wssig.oaug.org/). ![IMG_6718.jpg](http://farm1.static.flickr.com/179/388749477_d89cc5e85d_o.jpg). One of the very interesting things of this SIG is, like the J2EE SIG (Organized by OTUG, IOUG, OAUG and Oracle), developers, architects, and administrators of Fusion Middleware, the Database and Oracle Fusion applications are talking together. This reunion of people is good since we all from development to operations have a different view of systems. So during this panel we have introduced quickly the concepts, and then the audience jumped in for the Q&A session, as you can guess, we add the classical questions around Web Services for the enterprise such as what about security? Management? Life Cycle ?... and so on. We answered obviously, but I would say if you are lucky enough to be at San Francisco this week, please come to the Demo Ground especially Web Services, Web Services Manager and BPEL where you will see the Oracle products in action and you will be able to find experts to help you to answer your questions.

The main auditorium was packed to see the first keynote/show of Oracle Open World 2005, where Oracle presented some of the numerous charity efforts that it does, and offer some fun to the attendees with a nice show from [Dana Carvey](http://www.danacarvey.net/)

#### What about Oracle Blog dinner?

[Mark Rittman](http://www.rittman.net/) is organizing a dinner for the different Oracle bloggers, it will be at the [Paragon Restaurant](http://www.paragonrestaurant.com/sfhome.htm) at Second Street on Townsend at 8.00pm on Tuesday 20th. ( I will be there for sure...)
