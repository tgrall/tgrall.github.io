A long-awaited feature is now available on GitHub: share **actions** in your workflows in your enterprise from Internal Repositories ðŸ¤– !

When a developer does not find a suitable GitHub Action in the [Marketplace](http://github.com/marketplace), they can create their own, something that I have documented in the "[How to Write Custom GitHub Action](/blog/2021/10/30/how-to-write-a-github-action)" post.

Until today, Actions had to be stored in a public repository, to allow other repositories to use them in workflows *(or take a complex approach)*. This has changed ðŸŽ‰.

Now you can put your actions in an [internal](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/about-repositories#about-internal-repositories) repository; repositories visible to your whole enterprise.

Once your repository visibility is set to "Internal", in the **Settings** pages, click in the **Actions** section and select the proper **Access** configuration:
