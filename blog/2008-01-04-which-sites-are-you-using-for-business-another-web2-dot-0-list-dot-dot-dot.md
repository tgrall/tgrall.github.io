Disclaimer: you do probably already know all these sites if you are like me spending lot of time on the Internet... (too much time?) But still, some people could be interested, like the customer I have been working with lately...

During a presentation to a customer around Web 2.0 and Social Networking, which sites do I use myself and why they could be interested for customer and their business.... So I really quickly write up this list, and just want to share it here...


Social networking... and many more. More and more important in business.
