This contribution allows Spring applications to leverage the OracleAS transaction manager and its features. In addition to this contribution and some previous investments of Oracle in Spring, see the [Oracle and Spring](http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/java/spring.html) page of OTN; Oracle continues to invest more and more in Spring, as contributor or as user since, as stated by Rod, Spring has an important roles in  [Oracle Fusion Middleware](http://www.oracle.com/products/middleware/index.html), and its upcoming [Services Component Architecture](http://www.osoa.org/) offering.
