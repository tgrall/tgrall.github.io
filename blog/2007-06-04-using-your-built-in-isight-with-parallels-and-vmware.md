It is probably an old tipe, but I have just configured my Windows XP Parallels VMs
to use my MacBook buit-in iSight Web Cam using the driver that you can find here:
- [Download iSight Driver for XP](http://www.maconlysource.com/?p=885)

The site states that it does not work with Parallels, but I am using the release Build 3170 RC3 and I do not have any issue.

1. Start your VM
2. Download the Driver &amp; Unip zip

3. Grab the Built-In iSight using the Devices > USB  menu

4. Point the Windows Devices Manager Installer to the location of the Unzipped folder
5. and you are done...
