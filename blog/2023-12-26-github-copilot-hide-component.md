When working with React/Next, I find myself needing to hide a component based on a condition, in this case it was to hide an image when a field was empty. Instead of going through a Google or StackOverflow search, I turned to GitHub Copilot for assistance. Witness the efficiency and precision of Copilot in action by watching the following video:

Yet again, GitHub Copilot proves to be the hero of my coding journey â€“ making my day, one efficient line of code at a time!
