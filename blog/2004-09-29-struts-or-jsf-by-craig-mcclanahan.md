title: "Struts or JSF by Craig McClanahan"

---

Craig McClanahan has started a blog... and his second post -after a quick introduction- is about the 'hot' subject of the usage of [Struts or JSF](http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/craigmcc/20040927#struts_or_jsf_struts_and).

Quote:
>For new development, here's the best strategy for determining what to do:

> * Evaluate the two technologies individually, to see if they satisfy your requirements.
> * If one or the other technology is sufficient, go ahead and use it (it's easier to learn and use one technology rather than two where possible); keeping in mind, however, the caveats about Struts HTML tags mentioned above.
> * If your requirements include unique features supported only by Struts (such as Tiles or client side validation support), feel free to use the two frameworks together.
