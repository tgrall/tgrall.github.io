Looking forward to play around with EJB 3.0?

You can now download the OracleAS 3.0 Preview from OTN:
"[Oracle Application Server EJB 3.0 Preview](http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/java/ejb30.html)".

In addition to the container you can find documentation, demonstration and technical papers.

I am sure you will enjoy it, discover the new way of deal with persistence based on Java annotations...
