Oracle Open World is getting very close... And I am very excited to go to lot of sessions, two of them looks very interesting in the Oracle Develop track:

*   Rod Johnson - Spring Update: What's New and Cool in Spring 2.0 (Monday 10/23/2006, 12:45 PM - 1:45 PM in the Hilton Hotel Grand Ballroom A)
*   Brian Behlendorf - Bringing Open Source Software Development Practices and Principles Into Your Company (Tuesday 10/24/2006, 1:15 PM - 2:15 PM in the Hilton Hotel Grand Ballroom A)

This is quite exciting to have Open Source gurus coming to present to the Oracle conference, and explain how to use the new Spring in their projects or leverage Open Source practices to improve development in house... Take a look to the full program of Oracle Develop.
