title: "How to watch YouTube videos offline (on OS X)?"

Lately I have been traveling a lot, and I was not able to access the internet all the time; but I still want to look at some YouTube video, for example the greate Google I/O Sessions...

My needs are simple :

*   running on OS X (Lion)
*   download the video easily
*   no need to convert the file (to be able to read the file as soon as possible)
*   free

After some basic research, I found an easy way to achieve this using the following softwares:

*   [Enolsoft Free YouTube Downloader HD](http://www.enolsoft.com/free-youtube-downloader-hd-for-mac.html) : this software allows you to download easily the YouTube FLV on your hard drive.
*   [VLC Media Player](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-macosx.html) : to play the FLV file locally.
