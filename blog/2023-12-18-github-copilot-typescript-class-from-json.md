When working with NextJS and Typescript, I often find myself creating classes to represent data structures. In the course of doing so, I often need to create the class from a REST API response that is a JSON object.

To expedite this crucial task, I turned to GitHub Copilot for assistance. Witness the efficiency and precision of Copilot in action by watching the following video:

Yet again, GitHub Copilot proves to be the hero of my coding journey â€“ making my day, one efficient line of code at a time!
